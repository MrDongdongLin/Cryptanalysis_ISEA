This package of codes is correspoding to the paper:
Chengqing Li, Dongdong Lin, "Cryptanalysis of an Image Scrambling Encryption Algorithm", Xiangtan, China, September 17, 2016.

These folders contain codes about cipher-only attack and known plain-text attack on ISEA respectively, and file for calculating SSIM index is also introduced:
"IQA_MSssim" contains codes of SSIM is from Dr. Zhou Wang.
More details about these codes can be found at:
 http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/
"cna_matlab_codes" contains two matlab codes, "CorrAttack.m" was written by Weihai Li, Yupeng Yan, Nenghai Yu and slightly modifiled by us.

"kpa_matlab_codes" contains known plain-text attack on ISEA, You could run this project as follows:
Step 1. Run the KPA_ISEA function,
Step 2. Follow the tips. :-)

All the known images are enrcypted with the same screct keys:
Secrect keys of ISEA:
m 	= 20
n 	= 51
x0 	= 0.2009
mu 	= 3.98
iteratime = 4

See more details in each file.
