This paper re-evaluated security of a typical image scrambling encryption algorithm (ISEA) that proposed by Guodong Ye. ISEA was proposed by scrambling binary presentation of a gray-scale plain-image with a pseudo-random number sequence, generated by iterating a digital chaotic map.

There are codes about cipher-only attack and known plain-text attack on ISEA, and codes for calculating Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of an image are also introduced:

"IQA_MSssim" contains codes of SSIM is from Dr. Zhou Wang. More details about these codes can be found at:
http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/

"cna_matlab_codes" contains two matlab codes, "CorrAttack.m" was written by Weihai Li, Yupeng Yan, Nenghai Yu and slightly modifiled by us. More details about the paper correspoding to this code can be found at:

DOI:10.1145/2393347.2396392

"kpa_matlab_codes" introduces known plain-text attack on ISEA, You could run this project as follows:
Step 1. Run "KPA_ISEA".
Step 2. Follow the tips. :-)
/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

All the known images are enrcypted with the same screct keys:
Secrect keys of ISEA:
m 	= 20
n 	= 51
x0 	= 0.2009
mu 	= 3.98
iteratime = 4
